An interactive Jupyter Book for the highlighted paper by first author **Nan-kuei Chen** and second author **Pei-Hsin Wu**. The paper is entitled *â€œThe use of Fourier-domain analyses for unwrapping phase images of low SNR"*.


The Jupyter Book allows the demo script to be interactive inline (can change and run the code on the website) 
or launch a MyBinder session to run your code in a Jupyter Notebook in your browser, both options requiring no installation. 
They last section is for some of the figures and data from the paper, made interactive using <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>.
